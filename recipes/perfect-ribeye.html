        <p><strong>Ribeye </strong> is what we're tackling today. So stay tuned in order to learn how to cook the <em>perfect </em> ribeye. <strong><em>YUM</em></strong>!</p>
        <h2>First off, let's go over what you'll need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cut of ribeye meat (preferably something more <em>fatty</em> or with more <em>marbling</em>)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li><strong><em>*Optional*</em></strong> Chopped up garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And that's pretty much all we need to make the most <em>basic</em> ribeye that's still pretty <strong>bomb</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Now, let's move into how to actually fry this joint up!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong><em>Wash</em></strong> your ribeye. (I don't care if you're about to fry that shit up, just make sure to wash it. Be <em>clean</em> people.) </li>
            <li>Pat dry and then start sprinkling a generous amount of salt and garlic powder on it. <strong>Don't forget to get the sides of the steak</strong>!</li>
            <li>Cut up the garlic. Throw some oil in the pan.</li>
            <li>When it starts to get hot, throw the minced garlic in there. When it has a golden brown tint, throw the steak in the pan.</li>
            <li>Sear each side <strong>AND </strong>the sides until you have a nice golden brown crust.</li>
            <li>At this point, throw in the butter. Let it melt and start basting the steak.</li>
            <li>When the steak's internal temperature reachs 135 degrees, take it out and rest it on a plate for about 2-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy that shit.</li>
        </ol>
